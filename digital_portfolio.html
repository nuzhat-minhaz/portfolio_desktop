            <br> An informative site to help victims of cyber-crimes (such as connecting to emergency contacts, definitions, applicable laws, etc).
            It intends to have a chatbot interface to ease the process of finding information available on the site without having to search through pages, and a possible multi-client chat server 
            connection to a Response Team member of PrivaC to personally help out the victim/client.
            <br> 
            <br><span id="heavy"> Initial Design Goals:</span>
           
            <br>• Needs to have a layout that most users are familiar with
            <br>• Needs to be more multi-media heavy for users with minimal access to education (they're the easiest targets of cybercrimes, so they need more help)
            <br>• Cannot be visually overwhelming, should not present too much info all at once
            <br>• Needs more guided constraints for users to find appropriate and relevant info more efficiently
            <br>• Needs to have different colored themes for accessibility
            <span id="heavy">
                <br>

            <br>• Will need an accessible and standard Bangla version 
            <br>• Pinkish tones might make the site seem as though the project only caters to female victims

            <br> RIT Global Union is a Representative Student Organization on campus that aims to help international students with resources, connect with communities,

            <br><span id="heavy"> Design Goals:</span>
           <br> As this was part of my work as a Webmaster for RIT Global Union, I was given the following tasks to fulfill in terms of website functionality, look and feel:
           <br>
            <br>• Emphasizing on presence of the organization by providing sufficient information (e.g location, what we do, who we are)
            <br>• Make it bright and vibrant to welcome international students from diverse cultures that celebrates in different colors
            <br>• Utilize info and photos from past events and current affiliates
            <br>• Make the site easy to explore, add a simple navigation
            <br>• Make content simple and engaging, and intend to use the stories and identities of international students
            <span id="heavy">
                <br>
            <br>Drawbacks of Utilized Design Principles </span>
            <br>• Animation on the left takes up too much attention; might be too heavy on the eyes; homepage needs more whitespace
            <br>• Needs interactive content (such as a map) to engage user
